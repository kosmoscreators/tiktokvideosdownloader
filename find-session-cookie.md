# How to Find Your TikTok Session Cookie

The headers you provided don't include the Cookie header with the session. Here's how to find it:

## Method 1: Find Cookie Header

1. **Open TikTok**: Go to https://www.tiktok.com and login
2. **Open Developer Tools**: Press F12
3. **Go to Network Tab**: Click "Network" tab
4. **Refresh Page**: Press F5 to reload TikTok
5. **Click Any Request**: Look for requests to tiktok.com
6. **Find Request Headers**: Look for a section that says "Request Headers"
7. **Look for Cookie Line**: Find a line that starts with `cookie:` or `Cookie:`

The Cookie header should look something like:
```
cookie: sid_tt=abc123def456ghi789; sessionid=xyz789; tt_csrf_token=abc123; ...
```

## Method 2: Browser Console

1. **Open TikTok**: Make sure you're logged in
2. **Open Console**: Press F12 â†’ Console tab
3. **Run Command**: Type this and press Enter:
   ```javascript
   document.cookie
   ```
4. **Copy sid_tt**: Look for `sid_tt=` in the result and copy the entire value including the semicolon

## Method 3: Application Tab

1. **Open Developer Tools**: F12
2. **Application Tab**: Click "Application" tab
3. **Cookies Section**: Click "Cookies" in left sidebar
4. **TikTok Domain**: Click on https://www.tiktok.com
5. **Find sid_tt**: Look for a cookie named "sid_tt" and copy its value

## What You're Looking For:

The session should look like:
```
sid_tt=a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s9t0;
```

## Once You Have It:

Use it with our download script:
```powershell
.\download-with-session.ps1 "sid_tt=YOUR_ACTUAL_SESSION_VALUE;"
```

**Note**: The headers you showed me are missing the Cookie header entirely, which is why I can't see your session. Please try the methods above to find the actual cookie value.
